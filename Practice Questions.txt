3) Record the exact error message in a Markdown cell.

17. **Name starting with a number error (intentional)**

1) In a new cell, attempt to assign a string to `4you` exactly as shown in the PDF.
2) Run the cell to produce the error.
3) Record the exact error message in a Markdown cell.

18. **Another `$` naming error (intentional)**

1) In a new cell, attempt to assign a string to `$address` exactly like the PDF.
2) Run the cell to produce the error.
3) Record the exact error message in a Markdown cell.

19. **Invalid character in the middle (intentional)**

1) In a new cell, attempt to assign `6` to `abc$xyz` exactly as shown in the PDF.
2) Run the cell to produce the error.
3) Record the exact error message in a Markdown cell.

20. **Apply variable naming rule: begin with letter or underscore**

1) Create one valid variable name that begins with an underscore `_` and assign it a value.
2) Display the variable and its type.
3) Create one valid variable name that begins with a letter and assign it a value.
4) Display the variable and its type.

21. **Apply variable naming rule: allowed remaining characters**

1) Create three variables whose names include a mix of letters and digits (but do not start with a digit).
2) Create three variables whose names include underscores `_`.
3) Display each variable and its type.

22. **Build a small “shopping total” workflow**

1) Create variables for three items (one integer price, one float price, one integer price).
2) Add them into a `total` variable.
3) Create a boolean variable that checks whether your total is greater than `200`.
4) Display the total and the boolean value.
5) Display the types of both.

5) Reassign the same variable to a float value.
6) Display its type again.

24. **Print vs direct display**

1) Create a string variable with any text.
2) Show it by placing the variable name alone in a cell.
3) Show it again using `print()` in the same cell or a different cell.
4) Note the difference in formatting by writing a short observation in Markdown (no explanation of why—just what you notice).

25. **Object identity across multiple references**

1) Create a string variable `foo` with any string value.
2) Create `bar = foo`.
3) Create `baz = foo`.
4) Display `id(foo)`, `id(bar)`, and `id(baz)` each on separate lines/cells.
5) Reassign only `bar` to a different string.
6) Display the ids again for `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`.

26. **Type-checking a computed expression**

1) Create two numeric variables (one int, one float).
2) Add them into a new variable.
3) Display the result and its type.
4) Create a boolean variable using a comparison on that result (greater than some number).
5) Display the boolean and its type.

27. **Create a “rules checklist” cell**

1) Add a Markdown cell titled “Variable Naming Rules”.
2) Write the four rules exactly as described in the PDF (paraphrase is allowed, but keep meaning identical).
3) Under each rule, add one example variable name that follows the rule (do not include invalid examples here).

28. **Error collection notebook section**

1) Create a new Markdown heading: “Common Variable Naming Errors”.
2) Under it, list each of the invalid examples shown in the PDF.
3) For each one, run it in its own code cell (one invalid statement per cell).
4) Under each code cell, add a Markdown cell where you copy the exact error text produced.

29. **Mini audit of your notebook variables**

1) Choose any 6 variables you created in earlier tasks.
2) For each variable, display its value and type.
3) Reassign three of them to different values (change at least one to a different type).
4) Display their updated value and type.

30. **Replicate the PDF sequence (advanced replication task)**

1) In order, recreate the same variable creation and reassignment flow shown in the PDF for: `can`, `pizza`, `samosa`, `ice_cream`, `total`, `above_thresold`.
2) After each major step, display the value and the type exactly at the points where the PDF checks them.
3) Ensure you include at least one direct display (variable alone in a cell) and at least one `print()` display.
